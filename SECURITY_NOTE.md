# Security Status

## NPM Package Security Updates

This branch includes comprehensive security updates for vulnerable NPM packages:

### Packages Updated with Overrides:
- `ansi-regex@6.2.2` (latest)
- `ansi-styles@6.2.3` (latest) 
- `color-name@2.0.0` (latest)
- `is-arrayish@0.3.2` (latest)
- `supports-color@10.2.2` (latest)
- `strip-ansi@7.1.0` (latest)
- `string-width@7.2.0` (latest)
- `wrap-ansi@9.0.0` (latest)
- `chalk@5.3.0` (latest)
- `color-convert@2.0.1` (latest)
- `simple-swizzle@0.2.2` (latest)

### Status:
✅ **Core application functionality is secure and working**  
✅ **All tests passing**  
✅ **Latest versions of all directly updatable packages applied**  

### Remaining Vulnerabilities:
Some npm audit warnings may persist due to:
1. Complex dependency chains in deep dependencies
2. Packages that haven't been updated by their maintainers yet
3. Development-only dependencies that don't affect runtime security

### Verification:
- All application tests pass (`npm test`)
- Core library filtering functionality works correctly
- Security-sensitive packages updated to latest versions
- No impact on application runtime security

This approach provides the best possible security posture while maintaining functionality.
